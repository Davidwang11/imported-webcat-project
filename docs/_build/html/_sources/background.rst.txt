This package provides a Pythonic way to interface with the NOAA National Ocean Service Web Camera Applications Testbed (WebCAT). The real-time data is hosted on the `SECOORA site`_ (Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association), on the dedicated `WebCAT page`_. Historic data can also be accessed by retrieving files using specific HTTP requests (using a pattern described on the `WebCAT page`_). 

More details about WebCAT are available in this Open Access paper:
